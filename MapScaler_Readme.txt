This is a simple script to be used in the editor which allows to scale the current level.


Usage:
 - Open your map
 - Place the "MapScaler" actor into your map
 - Select the actor and set up "Update scale" to your desired scale
 - Click on "Update" once in order to start the process
   
   !!! Note: The "Update" checkbox won't be shown as ticked ever.

 - After the scaling process is done, which should be immediately, you can delete the actor
